# Product-Hackathon

## Getting started

This repository contains a minimal Node.js + Express skeleton that serves a static frontend from the `public/` folder and exposes a small example API at `/api/hello`.

Quick steps to run locally:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

For development with automatic restarts you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project structure

	- `server.js` - Express server that serves `public/` and provides API endpoints
	- `package.json` - scripts and dependencies
	- `public/` - static frontend files (HTML, JS, CSS)
	- `.gitignore` - common ignores

## Next steps

Suggestions you might want to add next:

- Convert the frontend to a React/Vite app in `client/` or `frontend/`.
- Add tests and CI.
- Add linting (ESLint/Prettier) and TypeScript.

WE CAN DO THIS!!!
